# -SQL-Python-Ecommerce-Project
This project involves analyzing a dataset to derive insights related to customer payments over multiple years. The analysis was carried out using SQL and Python, with the final insights visualized using Python libraries.

 ## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to explore a dataset, formulate key questions, and extract meaningful insights using data analysis techniques. The focus was on identifying the top customers based on their payment contributions each year.

## Process
### Data Exploration: 
The project began with a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and contents. This involved examining the fields, identifying potential questions, and determining how best to approach the analysis.

### Formulating Questions: 
After understanding the dataset, I formulated several questions to guide the analysis. The main goal was to identify key customers and their contributions over time.

### SQL Analysis: 
SQL was used to query the dataset, allowing for efficient data extraction and manipulation. This included grouping data, calculating totals, and ranking customers by their payment values on a yearly basis.

### Data Visualization: 
To better understand and communicate the insights, I used Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to visualize the results. The visualizations focused on showing the top customers' payment contributions per year, making it easier to see trends and patterns.

## Tools and Technologies
SQL: For querying and manipulating the dataset.
Python: For data handling, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating informative visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of combining SQL with Python for data analysis and visualization. By starting with a dataset and a few guiding questions, significant insights can be drawn that help understand customer behavior and drive business decisions.
